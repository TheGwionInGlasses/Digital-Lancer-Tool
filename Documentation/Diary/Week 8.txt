Week 8 Diary Entry 17/02-23/03

Absent from Group Tutorial due to illness.

1. Follow along Udemy Course
Description: Use this to help inform the design of the game https://www.udemy.com/course/unity-turn-based-strategy/
Status: complete
I'm using a multi level grid system for my game. This involves instantiating a grid system for every "level". This would allow for flying units in the future. I've created a pathlink object for searching for pathnodes between layers. It inherits from the UnityEditor so it can be used in the unity game engine editor.
There was yet another annoying bug with the offset in which I mistakenly added the offset to the altitude leading to some out of bounds bugs. I really aught to comment my code before I refactor and add to production. But all in all, I'm happy with the state of the spikework and think it should be refactored and added to the main repository now.
Hours worked: 21

2 Produce System Tests Document
Description: A system Test document to determine the completeness of game code.
Status: Incomplete
I have four agent templates I can add into the game. I might create system tests for each specific agent like I would with chess. However this could get complicated. I'll see how much time I can make for it.

1. Create a hexagonal column asset
Description: Create an asset for unity that would be helpful for level design
Status: Incomplete.

2. Produce System Tests Document
This is quite complete. Still there's more that can be added before I refactor my code to add to production.
